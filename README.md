# Dolomiti
Dolomiti is an online clothing store made by me.

After having a very memorable hike at a Piancavallo on the foothills of the Dolomites (Italian: Dolomiti) I decided to make some t-shirt designs for the group that went. Needing inspiration for a new website project I decided to make a Patagonia mock website called Piancavallo. I realized Piancavallo was the name of the ski resort residing on that hike. I then decided Dolomiti would be better in case I ever did make anything of this.

This is an ongoing project with many ins and outs I have not learned fully yet pertaining to e-commerce. So for now I focus on the html, css, Javascript. This is also a good outlet for me to design art that could work on clothing.
